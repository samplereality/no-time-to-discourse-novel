\section*{About This Novel}

\noindent\textit{No Time to Discourse} is a speculative atlas that explores climate disaster across North America through interactive mapping and generative flash fiction.

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent This novel was generated for NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month), transforming the web-based interactive experience of https://notime.now/ into a print format. Each page combines watercolor maps from Stamen Design with works of flash fiction, which are procedurally-generated through bespoke RiTa.js grammars developed by Mark Sample.

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent Each of the stories in this novel is a work of fiction, yet each also attempts to capture at a human level the realities of climate disaster.

\textit{Wednesday, March 4, 2026}\\
 The storm came on fast. The sky over Richmond turned black. Eva had a fleeting thought, that she had left her soccer ball outside. We had no gas, no heat, no lights. They trucked in bottled water, since nothing was safe to drink.}

\textit{Friday, January 14, 2028}\\
 The storm isn't even over before the stream bursts its banks, the water rising 49 feet and swamping parts of Muncie. It's bad enough when Saoirse sees Delaware Country Club wash away, but then she hears  about the playground. Twenty missing.}

\textit{Tuesday, November 24, 2026}\\
 Rank dark water swamps Jocelyn's basement. A frozen ravioli bobs in the dark water. Tripp boils his water before cooking. The storm didn't even have a name, he thinks. Rescue teams are tired, so tired. }

\storybox{0.40}{0.40}{\textbf{Newhalen, Alaska}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Tuesday, November 24, 2082}\\
 A warm wind blows through Newhalen. The streets are empty. Deserted. The fires, the floods, hell, the locusts, it was all too much. We all went farther north, farther west, farther east, anywhere but here.}

\storybox{0.40}{3.90}{\textbf{Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Saturday, November 24, 2091}\\
 Tuktoyaktuk is flooded with refugees. They trudge in pulling wagons full of useless thingscedar chests, chairs, hearing aids. They come from the cities, the towns. Seattle. Philadelphia. Places too broken to fix.}

\storybox{0.40}{7.40}{\textbf{Grand Rapids, Michigan}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Thursday, January 20, 2028}\\
 The storm came on fast, like a bolt of lightning. The sky over Grand Rapids darkened. Serenity had a fleeting thought, that she had left her street light outside. The clocks stopped at 10:28 AM. They trucked in bottled water, since nothing was safe to drink.}

\textit{Saturday, February 17, 2029}\\
 ``It's hotter than Hades,'' they say. They're right. Hades is the devil's icebox compared to this. The street bleeds in the February heat. The ambient sound of ten thousand air conditioners washes over the land.}

\storybox{0.66}{7.00}{\textbf{Lansing, Michigan}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Thursday, April 9, 2026}\\
 The storm had been gathering for days. The barometer was dropping. The air was thick. When the storm finally came to Lansing, it was devastating. Cedric watched as the storm lashed against his windows. Meanwhile Mustafa spins up his TikTok channel, ranting about solar radiation management. A thousand views and counting.}

\storybox{3.71}{3.87}{\textbf{Fort Wayne, Indiana}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Tuesday, September 8, 2026}\\
 ``It's a scorcher today,'' they say. Today? You mean this year. The road to the Fort Wayne Children's Zoo is jammed with abandoned cars, shimmering in the heat. Not a single bird flies in the silent sky.}

\storybox{3.65}{7.76}{\textbf{Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Wednesday, December 16, 2026}\\
 The fire department had to truck in water to fill their tanks, and Pittsburgh is dying. Weathered docks cook uncovered in the scorching sun. It's like the surface of Mars, thinks Maylee. It hasn't rained in what feels like years. The livestock are barely holding on. She stands there in a haze.}

\storybox{0.40}{0.40}{\textbf{Wheeling, West Virginia}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Thursday, May 31, 2029}\\
 The wells run low, and the earth withers, shrouded in silence. Tangles of trash lie bare in the scorching sun. It's something out of a sci-fi movie, thinks Kaiden. It's been seven months since rain. The trees are dead. Ash swirls in the breeze, clogging his throat.}

\storybox{5.34}{4.14}{\textbf{Rochester, New York}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Monday, December 21, 2026}\\
 A foul layer of dust coats the Public Market, and the wells run dry. Fish lie uncovered in the scorching sun. It's something out of a post-apocalyptic movie, thinks Kayla. It's been eleven months since rain. The towns are dying. Tech executives tweet about water conservation from their rooftop infinity pools.}

 By day Kai washes laundry at the Makai Kai Resort. In the evening he boils drinking water, what little of it he has. At night he dreams of gleaming towels, whiter than white.}

\storybox{0.40}{3.90}{\textbf{Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Wednesday, July 22, 2026}\\
 The storm came suddenly, with astonishing speed. The sky over Pittsburgh turned black. Wyatt had a fleeting thought, that he had left his watch outside. We had no gas, no heat, no lights. They trucked in bottled water, since nothing was safe to drink.}

\storybox{0.40}{7.40}{\textbf{Halifax, Nova Scotia}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Monday, February 5, 2029}\\
 The storm isn't even over before the river swells, the water rising 46 feet and flooding parts of Halifax. It's bad enough when Monroe sees Real Atlantic Superstore wash away, but then she hears  about the playground. Eleven missing.}

 ``It's hotter than Hades,'' they say. They're right. Hades is the devil's icebox compared to this. Melvin blows out his tire on his way home from work. The tire is a liquefied gooey mess. Not a single bird flies in the silent sky.}

\storybox{5.05}{6.23}{\textbf{Baddeck, Nova Scotia}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Saturday, October 10, 2026}\\
 The storm isn't even over before the creek bursts its banks, the water rising 42 feet and inundating parts of Baddeck. It's bad enough when Natalia sees Tom's Pizza wash away, but then she hears on the news about the preschool. Twenty-five missing.}

\storybox{1.38}{1.80}{\textbf{Trout River, Newfoundland and Labrador}\\[0.1in]
\textit{Wednesday, October 24, 2029}\\
 ``It's not the heat,'' they say, ``it's the humidity.'' No. It's the heat. The tracks near Trout River buckle, a sun kink it's called, and all rail travel stops for the week. Not a single bird flies in the silent sky.}

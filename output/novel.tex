\section*{About This Novel}

\noindent\textit{No Time to Discourse} is a speculative atlas that explores climate disaster across North America through interactive mapping and generative flash fiction.

\vspace{0.3in}

This novel was generated for NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month), transforming the web-based interactive experience into a print format. Each page combines watercolor maps from Stamen Design with procedurally-generated stories created through RiTa.js grammars.

\vspace{0.3in}

Each of the stories in this novel is a work of fiction, yet each also attempts to capture at a human level the realities of climate disaster.

\textit{Monday, November 23, 2093}\\
 The Truth Social correspondent stands in front of a tent city. ``Tensions between factions in Fort Nelson have only gotten worse,'' he reports. ``Ever since 2074, housing has been in short supply.'' The camera pans to solar panels jerry-rigged to shipping containers.}

\textit{Saturday, February 24, 2029}\\
 ``It's not the heat,'' they say, ``it's the humidity.'' No. It's the heat. The tarmac bubbles in the February heat. The power lines hum with dark magic.}

 ``You could fry an egg on the sidewalk,'' they say. No. Not when the sidewalk itself is melting. Kaiden got third degree burns just walking to his car. Urgent Care was closed.}

\textit{Monday, March 19, 2029}\\

\textit{Saturday, September 18, 2027}\\
 Aubriella's house was destroyed. The fire jumped the firebreak this morning. She remembers the most random things. A bowl. A lamp. Class rings. All lost. Is it the smoke that makes it hard to breathe?}

\textit{Friday, July 20, 2029}\\
 The rivers are empty, and the land is dust. Gnarled roots cook  in the  sun. It's like the surface of the moon, thinks Josie. It hasn't rained in months. The livestock are dying. Meaningless words tumble around in her head. \textit{Wellhead, capabilities. Exhilaration}.}

 Sariyah hears on the radio that dozens are stranded as flash flooding inundates Crossroads County Market. The problem is water, there's too much of it, marvels Baylee. She didn't think it would happen here. Emergency teams are coming, maybe? }

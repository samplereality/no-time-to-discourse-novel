\section*{About This Novel}

\noindent\textit{No Time to Discourse} is a speculative atlas that explores climate disaster across North America through interactive mapping and generative flash fiction.

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent This novel was generated for NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month), transforming the web-based interactive experience of https://notime.now/ into a print format. Each page combines watercolor maps from Stamen Design with works of flash fiction, which are procedurally-generated through bespoke RiTa.js grammars developed by Mark Sample.

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent Each of the stories in this novel is a work of fiction, yet each also attempts to capture at a human level the realities of climate disaster.

You stare dumbly at the screen, your ashen face awash in blue light of your tablet. The fires are hundreds of miles away but you still smell smoke. What are you going to do?}

\textit{Tuesday, December 26, 2028}\\
 The earth withers, wicked and brown, and the wells run dry. Tangles of trash broil uncovered in the  sun. The trees are dead. It's something out of a post-apocalyptic movie, thinks Samuel. It's been nine months since rain. Ash blows in the breeze, clogging his throat.}

\textit{Sunday, November 4, 2029}\\
 Hurricane Lilliana exploded from a tropical storm to Category 4 in hours, following the path forecasters feared most. Lilliana decided to stay, having survived Andrew in '92. Now she wished she'd listened as the roof began to leak. When it passed, she found New Orleans unrecognizable. She wondered if this was God's way of saying the coast was no longer for sale.}

 Hurricane Kori roared ashore as a Category 5 monster, defying every computer model. Kori evacuated to a church basement with only what fit in the car. She watched the news obsessively, hoping desperately her garden she'd spent years cultivating would survive. Coast Guard helicopters plucked her from her roof at dawn. She didn't have flood insurance, or any insurance, really.}

 The city is burning, dear Lord. There are scores of fires closing in on the Elkhorn Valley Museum. What caused the fires? A campfire? The spark from a mower blade striking a rock? Does it matter? It might as well have been a meteor strike.}

 The aquifers run low, and Manhattan is dying. Desiccated bones lie uncovered in the scorching sun. The fields are dying. It's something out of a post-apocalyptic movie, thinks Henley. It hasn't rained in months. Dust gusts in the air, gritty on her skin.}

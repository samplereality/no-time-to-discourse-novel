\section*{About This Novel}

\noindent\textit{No Time to Discourse} is a speculative atlas that explores climate disaster across North America through interactive mapping and generative flash fiction.

\vspace{0.3in}

This novel was generated for NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month), transforming the web-based interactive experience into a print format. Each page combines watercolor maps from Stamen Design with procedurally-generated stories created through RiTa.js grammars.

\vspace{0.3in}

Each of the stories in this novel is a work of fiction, yet each also attempts to capture at a human level the realities of climate disaster.

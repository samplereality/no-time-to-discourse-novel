\newpage
\section*{About This Novel}

\noindent\textit{No Time to Discourse} is a speculative atlas that explores climate disaster across North America through interactive mapping and generative flash fiction.

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent This novel was generated for NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month), transforming the web-based interactive experience of https://notime.now/ into a print format. Each page combines watercolor maps from Stamen Design with works of flash fiction, which are procedurally-generated through bespoke RiTa.js grammars developed by Mark Sample.

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent Each of the stories in this novel is a work of fiction, yet each also attempts to capture at a human level the realities of climate disaster.

 The wells run dry, and a foul layer of dust covers Papago Park. Weathered docks roast uncovered in the  sun. The crops are dead. It's like the surface of the moon, thinks Mara. It hasn't rained in what feels like years. She can't take much more of this.}

 Hurricane Aislinn roared ashore as a Category 5 monster, catching meteorologists off guard. Ezra evacuated to a friend's house three states away with only what fit in the car. He called neighbors who didn't answer, wondering if his house would survive. The hurricane redefined geography. Streets became rivers, parking lots lakes, and home was just a GPS coordinate in the middle of nowhere. He couldn't stop refreshing the missing persons list, looking for names he recognized.}

 Hurricane Payton intensified over the warm Gulf waters, following the path forecasters feared most. Payton decided to stay, having survived Andrew in '92.

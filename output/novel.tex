\section*{About This Novel}

\noindent\textit{No Time to Discourse} is a speculative atlas that explores climate disaster across North America through interactive mapping and generative flash fiction.

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent This novel was generated for NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month), transforming the web-based interactive experience of https://notime.now/ into a print format. Each page combines watercolor maps from Stamen Design with works of flash fiction, which are procedurally-generated through bespoke RiTa.js grammars developed by Mark Sample.

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent Each of the stories in this novel is a work of fiction, yet each also attempts to capture at a human level the realities of climate disaster.
